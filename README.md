# Introduction to GIS Methods | Spring 2019
## Barnard College Urban Studies UN2200
## Professor Adam Lubitz

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to the analysis of evidence and development of arguments in urban
studies, with an emphasis on the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. Beyond
map production, GIS is a tool that allows you to integrate geography with data, in order to view,
manage, and analyze information about the places you want to study. GIS is a central instrument in a
number of professional fields, including urban planning, public health, historic preservation, and
environmental science. Its usage has seen growing importance due to the increased theoretical
attention to spatial issues in urban analyses as well as the increasing accessibility of GIS technology.
Priority for enrollment is given to Urban Studies majors and upper-level students.

In both geographic and non-geographic analysis, the course will focus on:
<br>
● Theory: Spatial Intelligence and Data Acquisition;
<br>
● Application: Technical Knowledge and Software Familiarity; and
<br>
● Design: Articulation of Concepts and Map Clarity.

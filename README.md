# Introduction to GIS Methods | Spring 2019
## Barnard College Urban Studies UN2200 | Professor Adam Lubitz

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to the analysis of evidence and development of arguments in urban
studies, with an emphasis on the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. Beyond
map production, GIS is a tool that allows you to integrate geography with data, in order to view,
manage, and analyze information about the places you want to study. GIS is a central instrument in a
number of professional fields, including urban planning, public health, historic preservation, and
environmental science. Its usage has seen growing importance due to the increased theoretical
attention to spatial issues in urban analyses as well as the increasing accessibility of GIS technology.
Priority for enrollment is given to Urban Studies majors and upper-level students.

In both geographic and non-geographic analysis, the course will focus on:
<br>
● Theory: Spatial Intelligence and Data Acquisition;
<br>
● Application: Technical Knowledge and Software Familiarity; and
<br>
● Design: Articulation of Concepts and Map Clarity.

## Student Learning Objectives
The course seeks to ensure students develop a basic familiarity with the most commonly-used
methods of analysis using GIS, such that the wide range of possibilities of its applications and
interpretations is understood at a fundamental level. This will allow students to engage critically
and effectively with its growing number of applications.

Thus the objectives of this course are
<br>
(1) Providing an understanding of introductory-level skills necessary to work with GIS,
predominantly using ESRI’s ArcGIS software;
<br>
(2) Identifying (and, when necessary, constructing) variables from publicly available data sets that
measure spatial variation important to an urban analysis;
<br>
(3) Using GIS technology to make <b>simple</b> and <b>convincing</b> analyses of spatial relationships;
<br>
(4) Ensuring an introductory understanding of the ethical questions surrounding data creation,
analysis, and representation in urban contexts; and
<br>
(5) Critically evaluating maps and map-based arguments on urban topics in both scholarly work
and journalism.

## Methods of Instruction
In lieu of a required text, in-class exercises, assignments, and readings will be posted to Canvas for
the following week. Given the emphasis on computer-based lab work in this course, care has been
taken to only include necessary readings within this course. Likewise, since much of the core,
technical learning comes from repetition and/or trial and error, the first half of the semester will
focus on weekly assignments which highlight the key functions of ArcGIS software. The in-class 
exercises and on-your-own assignments are largely derived from these sources:
<br>
● GIS Tutorial 1: Basic Workbook for ArcGIS 10 (Wilpen L. Gorr and Kristen S. Kurland, 2011)
<br>
● Getting to Know ArcGIS Desktop, Second Edition, Updated for ArcGIS 10 (Tim Orms, Eileen J.
Napoleon, Robert Burke, Carolyn Groessl, and Laura Bowden, 2010)
<br>
● The GIS 20: Essential Skills (Gina Clemmer, 2010)
<br>
Occasional reading assignments and supplemental readings will be uploaded to Canvas. While there
is no required text for this course, the following texts are recommended, as they have been used for
this course in previous semesters:
<br>
● Mastering ArcGIS (Maribeth Price, 2016)
<br>
● GIS for the Urban Environment (Juliana Maantay and John Ziegler, 2006)

## External Hard Drive or Flash Drive
Despite how this technology may seem near-obsolete, it is <b>required</b> that everyone have an external
storage device, such as an external hard drive or USB flash drive, for use in this class. The external
storage device will enable you to work seamlessly on any computer that runs ArcMap, and help
prevent loss or corruption of data. I recommend a minimum of <b>16 GB of free space</b>. The external
storage device must be brought with you to every class, starting week one.

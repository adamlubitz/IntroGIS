# Introduction to GIS Methods | Spring 2019
## Barnard College Urban Studies UN2200 | Professor Adam Lubitz

## Course Description
This course is an introduction to the analysis of evidence and development of arguments in urban
studies, with an emphasis on the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. Beyond
map production, GIS is a tool that allows you to integrate geography with data, in order to view,
manage, and analyze information about the places you want to study. GIS is a central instrument in a
number of professional fields, including urban planning, public health, historic preservation, and
environmental science. Its usage has seen growing importance due to the increased theoretical
attention to spatial issues in urban analyses as well as the increasing accessibility of GIS technology.
Priority for enrollment is given to Urban Studies majors and upper-level students.

In both geographic and non-geographic analysis, the course will focus on:
<br>
● Theory: Spatial Intelligence and Data Acquisition;
<br>
● Application: Technical Knowledge and Software Familiarity; and
<br>
● Design: Articulation of Concepts and Map Clarity.

## Student Learning Objectives
The course seeks to ensure students develop a basic familiarity with the most commonly-used
methods of analysis using GIS, such that the wide range of possibilities of its applications and
interpretations is understood at a fundamental level. This will allow students to engage critically
and effectively with its growing number of applications.

Thus the objectives of this course are
<br>
(1) Providing an understanding of introductory-level skills necessary to work with GIS,
predominantly using ESRI’s ArcGIS software;
<br>
(2) Identifying (and, when necessary, constructing) variables from publicly available data sets that
measure spatial variation important to an urban analysis;
<br>
(3) Using GIS technology to make <b>simple</b> and <b>convincing</b> analyses of spatial relationships;
<br>
(4) Ensuring an introductory understanding of the ethical questions surrounding data creation,
analysis, and representation in urban contexts; and
<br>
(5) Critically evaluating maps and map-based arguments on urban topics in both scholarly work
and journalism.

## Methods of Instruction
In lieu of a required text, in-class exercises, assignments, and readings will be posted to Canvas for
the following week. Given the emphasis on computer-based lab work in this course, care has been
taken to only include necessary readings within this course. Likewise, since much of the core,
technical learning comes from repetition and/or trial and error, the first half of the semester will
focus on weekly assignments which highlight the key functions of ArcGIS software. The in-class 
exercises and on-your-own assignments are largely derived from these sources:
<br>
● GIS Tutorial 1: Basic Workbook for ArcGIS 10 (Wilpen L. Gorr and Kristen S. Kurland, 2011)
<br>
● Getting to Know ArcGIS Desktop, Second Edition, Updated for ArcGIS 10 (Tim Orms, Eileen J.
Napoleon, Robert Burke, Carolyn Groessl, and Laura Bowden, 2010)
<br>
● The GIS 20: Essential Skills (Gina Clemmer, 2010)
<br>
Occasional reading assignments and supplemental readings will be uploaded to Canvas. While there
is no required text for this course, the following texts are recommended, as they have been used for
this course in previous semesters:
<br>
● Mastering ArcGIS (Maribeth Price, 2016)
<br>
● GIS for the Urban Environment (Juliana Maantay and John Ziegler, 2006)

## External Hard Drive or Flash Drive
Despite how this technology may seem near-obsolete, it is <b>required</b> that everyone have an external
storage device, such as an external hard drive or USB flash drive, for use in this class. The external
storage device will enable you to work seamlessly on any computer that runs ArcMap, and help
prevent loss or corruption of data. I recommend a minimum of <b>16 GB of free space</b>. The external
storage device must be brought with you to every class, starting week one.

## Grading
5% – Class Participation & Preparation
<br>
5% – Group Case Study Presentations
<br>
10% – Midterm Exam
<br>
50% – On-Your-Own Assignments (8 in total, 4-8% each)
<br>

<br>
= 100% (Plus a potential 2% from Extra Credit assignment)

## Attendance (5%)
All students are expected to attend both lecture (Tuesdays) and lab (Thursdays) sessions. Regular
attendance, along with participation during pin-ups and other presentations by classmates, factors
into the final grade. Students who will miss class due to religious holidays or other appropriate
reasons should email the professor and TA in the first week of classes with the dates (and reasons) of
their foreseen absences and are encouraged to make arrangements with their peers for notes.
Students with disabilities who require accommodations or academic adjustments for this course
must either enroll in the Program for Academic Access or register with the Office of Disabilities. For
any accommodation, the instructor must be presented with either a letter from the Assistant 
Director of the Program for Academic Access or an Accommodations Card from the Office of
Disabilities during the first week of classes.

## Group Case Study Presentations (5%) and Midterm Exam (10%)
Week 8 will consist of short presentations on case studies of GIS-related work of your choosing.
These will be given in teams of two -- further details will be discussed during Week 6. The midterm
exam will be a take-home exam which tests your understanding of the lectures, readings, and
techniques learned in the first half of the semester. It will be uploaded at the end of Week 8 on
March 14th and due Thursday, March 28th at 6pm. Unexcused late midterms will not be accepted.

## On-Your-Own Assignments (50%)
For the eight (8) “on-your-own” assignments, all instructions are noted, including what to upload to
Canvas. All assignments must be submitted by 6pm (prior to the start of class) on the day the
assignment is due. Read the instructions carefully and make sure you upload all required
deliverables. Points will be deducted for unexcused lateness or incomplete assignments.

## Final Project (30%)
Your final project should relate in some way to the field of your declared (or planned) major. You
can create or collect your own data with the goal of answering a research question using ArcGIS. It
is perfectly acceptable (even encouraged) to create a project that will also be helpful for another
class or your senior thesis. This project is intentionally broad to allow you to work on a subject that
interests you. I recommend thinking about possible projects as soon as possible. A full assignment
description will be distributed before the midterm.
<br> <br>
There will be five deliverables for the final project: <br>
Topic paragraph, detailing scope and data sources for the project (5%) - Tuesday, April 2nd <br>
Proposal with revised paragraph and methods summary (5%) - Thursday, April 11th <br>
Maps (pin-up, part of your participation grade) - April 16th and 18th <br>
Final review (10%) - April 30th and May 2nd <br>
Final report deliverable uploaded onto github for sharing (10%) - due Friday, May 10th by 6pm <br>
<br>
Students are required to submit a topic paragraph with data sources prior to carrying out the
project at the start of Week 10 (5% of final grade), and much of the class time toward the end of the
semester is reserved for individual guidance with the professor and TA during desk crits, where we
can discuss developing the scope, feasibility, and possible/expected results of your project.
<br>
<br>
Due to the nature of ongoing GIS work being shared between practitioners, and in the spirit of open
data, final deliverables include a written and graphical report uploaded onto the course github
repository (10% of final grade), along with a presentation or "review" (10% of final grade). Final 
presentations will be given before a panel of invited guests (TBD) for feedback to be incorporated in
the final report. They will be divided into two sessions, April 30th and May 2nd. PDFs of your final
presentations must be submitted on Canvas by 5pm before the earlier session on April 30th in order
to ensure fairness for all students.

## Professor and TA
The TA will attend the lab sessions on Thursdays and be responsible for providing assistance on
in-class and on-your-own assignments throughout the semester, as well as feedback on final
projects. In addition to office hours, students may contact the professor or the TA via email, and we
will do our best to respond to your emails promptly. However, since time management is a vital skill,
please do not rely on the night before due dates to email questions. If you email a technical question
to the professor and/or TA, be sure to include enough information for us to best help you, including
a detailed description of what you are trying to accomplish and the problem you are encountering,
any relevant information regarding the data sets you are using, the steps you have already taken (so
we don’t tell you to do what you’ve already done), and any necessary screenshots to help us
understand what you are doing when we cannot sit with you in front of a computer.
